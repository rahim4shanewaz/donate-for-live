                    <p> <strong>Education is the foundation of health and happiness.</strong><br>
                        Innovations that dramatically facilitate learning will propel human progress, just as the Industrial Revolution changed humanity and lifted people out of poverty. <br> <strong> are on the cusp of a learning revolution which will transform the world </strong> 
                        Teach the World has harnessed the latest technology to spark a transformation in how we think about education. Through the gamification of learning and the availability of tablets, we’re empowering children who have no access to education by putting the tools to learn in their own hands.<br>
                         <strong>With your donation, you are giving a child limitless opportunities for a better life.
                         </strong> <br> Your support today is changing 2500+ lives in the most marginalized communities in the world, by giving them the gift of education. Your donation will fund our overall program. It will support staffing, educational-software, technology, program support, research & development.<br>
                         <strong> Making the world a better place</strong> <br>
